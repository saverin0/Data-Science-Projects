   - Fetch data from the Spotify API regarding song genres, popularity, and release dates.

2. **Data Transformation:**  
   - Process and clean the extracted data to focus on relevant attributes.
   - Aggregate data to determine genre popularity trends over specified time frames.

3. **Data Loading:**  
   - Store the transformed data into a database or data warehouse for analysis.

4. **Analysis & Visualization:**  
   - Create visualizations to depict the rise and fall of genre popularity over time.
   - Identify patterns or anomalies in genre trends.

**How to Run:**  
1. Ensure Python and Apache Airflow are installed.
2. Set up necessary API credentials for Spotify.
3. Configure the Airflow DAG as per the project documentation.
4. Trigger the DAG to run the pipeline.
